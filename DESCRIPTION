Authors@R: 
    person(given = "First",
           family = "Last",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "first.last@example.com",

Description: This is currently a spaghetti mess of small functions to use at the
    store. If any of them get big/heavily used enough, I'll split them out into
    their own package then.
